# E-N 325 Intro

The *Small Studio* is equipped with a combined WFS/Ambisonics sound field synthesis system for production and research, alongside an eight channel loudspeaker setup for regular production. 

The Small Studio can be used in two Modes: Direct Mode and Seamless Mode.

Direct Mode allows direct access to the speakers in the octa setup and the Ambisonics Dome. The Seamless mode uses a rendering system to spatialize up to 32 seperate audio channels into the Ambisonics dome and the WFS-System.
